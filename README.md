# Autotranscoder

Using ffmpeg, automatically transcode video for editing.
If your video was recorded in any resolution other than 4096x2160 @ 30fps, you're going to have a bad time.

# Requirements

* v3.4 of ffmpeg
* Avid dnxhr codecs
* Lots of processing power

# Usage

`./find-and-transcode.sh [FILENAME]`
